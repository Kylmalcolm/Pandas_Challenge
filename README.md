Observable trends:

1) Considering that females make up a large portion of the mobile game market, this game is heavily dominated by male players. While targeting specific groups makes sense for certain games, women, non-binary people, and those who chose not to disclose gender information spend slightly more on average. It might be worth seeing what can be done to attract a wider audience.

2) The majority of players are in the age range of 20-24 and have one of the highest spending averages of the game. However the younger than 10 and 35-39 age bracket spend more on average. All ages and genders are hovering around the $4.00 mark on average spending and the top five are around $18-13 which is incredibly low for a 'freemium' mobile game. Clash of Clans this is not. What appeals to the users who are most likely to spend on premium items and can new categories of things to buy beyond weapons be considered?

3) The most popular items are Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm. The difference between these items - which sold 13 and 12 times respectively - compared to the the next highest group which sold nine times is not huge. However, it might be worth looking at the perceived player value of these items and potentially designing similar ones that are at a higher pricepoint.
